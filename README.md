# nosql_data_modelling

In this project, I recreate what I did in my [relational data modelling project](https://github.com/dunyaoguz/relational_data_modelling) for a NOSQL database. 

### Project Components
1) Building an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to tables in an Apache Cassandra database 
2) Creating tables in Apache Cassandra based on specific queries that will need to be run on the data
